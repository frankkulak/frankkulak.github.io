      Computer science has always fascinated me - from programming on my
      calculator in middle school, to studying mobile app development in high
      school, to my B.S. in Computer Science and Linguistics at <InlineLink
        href="https://northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</InlineLink
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Northeastern, I completed two co-ops with <InlineLink
        href="https://tjx.com">The TJX Companies</InlineLink
      >, where I am currently employed full-time. At TJX, I contribute to the
      front end of four cross-platform retail apps and various back end
      projects.

      In my off-hours, you'll find me working on pet projects like websites,
      mods and modding tools for The Sims 4, and toying around with game
      development. While not glued to a screen, I enjoy walks on nature trails
      or in the city.
