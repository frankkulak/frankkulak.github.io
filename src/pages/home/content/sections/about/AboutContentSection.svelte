      Back in middle school, my journey with programming began by writing
      scripts on my TI-84 calculator. This piqued my interest in taking computer
      science courses during high school, which, combined with my fascination of
      language, led to my B.S. in Computer Science and Linguistics at <InlineLink
        href="https://northeastern.edu">Northeastern University</InlineLink
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at Northeastern, I completed two co-ops at <InlineLink
        href="https://tjx.com">The TJX Companies</InlineLink
      >, which brought me to my current full-time position on the mobile apps
      team. At TJX, I contribute to the front end of four cross-platform retail
      apps and various back end projects, such as our Apple / Google Wallet
      APIs.

      In my off-hours, you'll find me working on pet projects, such as my <InlineLink
        href="https://frankkmods.com/#/mods">Sims 4 mods</InlineLink
      > and <InlineLink href="https://frankkmods.com/#/tools"
        >modding tools</InlineLink
      > or toying around with game development. When not glued to a screen, I enjoy
      walks on nature trails or in the city.
