# frankkulak.github.io (frankkulak.com)

Welcome to the repository for my [portfolio website](https://frankkulak.com)!

The purpose of this website is to provide a comprehensive history of my academic and professional background, as well as showcasing projects I have worked on independently. You may feel free to examine this repository for a sense of my web development skills, or any of my other public repositories for a sense of other programming skills.

I test this website in as many browsers and platforms as possible before publishing any changes, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know what the issue is, as well as the browser and OS you were on. Thanks!

This site is still under construction and is updated frequently, so be sure to check back later!
