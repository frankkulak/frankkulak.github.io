# frankkulak.github.io (frankkulak.com)

On [frankkulak.com](https://frankkulak.com), you can find a summary of my education, professional experience, and personal projects.

I built it with Vue.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Sass. I'm a self-taught web developer, so any suggestions you have to improve the quality of my website and its code are very welcome! Please reference my more recent [mods website](https://mods.frankkulak.com) for a better example of my web development skills.

Due to my own hardware limitations, I am only able to test this website with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on macOS and an iOS simulator before updates are released. I try to be as mindful of browser compatability as possible, but bugs sometimes sneak through - if you experience anything weird, please let me know by [emailing me](mailto:me@frankkulak.com) or [submitting an issue](https://github.com/frankkulak/frankkulak.github.io/issues)!
