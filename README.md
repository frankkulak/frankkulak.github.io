# frankkulak.github.io (frankkulak.com)

On [frankkulak.com](https://frankkulak.com), you can find a summary of my education, professional experience, and personal projects. I actively maintain this website and update it often.

I built it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making use of Vue.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Sass. I host the website right here on GitHub. I'm a self-taught web developer, so any suggestions you have to improve the quality of my website and its code are very welcome!

Due to my own hardware limitations, I am only able to test this website with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on macOS before updates are released. I try to be as mindful of browser compatability as possible\*, but bugs sometimes sneak through - if you experience anything weird, please let me know by [emailing me](mailto:me@frankkulak.com) or [submitting an issue](https://github.com/frankkulak/frankkulak.github.io/issues)!

\* = Please note that I am aware that I do not currently support Internet Explorer. I plan to integrate Babel at some point to increase compatability.
